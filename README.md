Is it rude to decline your seat on a plane?

### Why I picked this question:
I picked the question on whether or not it is rude to recline your seat on a plane because I have personally always wondered what other people thought about lowering the seat. As a 6'0" person, I often find it pretty frustrating when the person in front of me reclines their seat because it makes my already limited leg space even smaller. While I do find it somewhat frustrating, I also understand it can be really difficult for people to sleep upright, so reclining might me necessary for a lot of people to sleep on planes. 

### About the dataset:
I thought this dataset was somewhat surprising because a good number of people said that reclining was not rude at all. From my experiences on planes, people tend to look a bit disgruntled when the person in front of them reclines, so I was surprised by this response. 

### My chart:

My bar chart describes how the majority of people aligned more closely with the opinion that reclining was not rude at all, followed by it being somewhat rude, and then very rude. This chart demonstrates that people tend to be more patient and understanding with reclining seats when it comes to proper flying etiquette.
